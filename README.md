# Jic Jack Jo

A web-based tic-tac-toe game using Narwhal and Jack

The idea is to build a very simple tic-tac-toe game that can be played by people who connect to the server over HTTP.

Mostly a learning exercise.

Installation:

1. [Install narwhal.][http://narwhaljs.org/quick-start.html]
2. `tusk install jic-jack-jo`
3. `cd jic-jack-jo`
4. `jackup`
